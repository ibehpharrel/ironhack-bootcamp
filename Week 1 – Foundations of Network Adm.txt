Week 1 – Foundations of Network Administration

During my first week at Ironhack, I was introduced to the core principles of network administration — the backbone of cybersecurity.

Before you can secure a system, you must understand how it communicates.

🌐 Introduction to Network Administration

Network administration focuses on managing, maintaining, and securing communication between devices.

Every time devices connect — laptops, phones, servers — they rely on a network administrator’s work behind the scenes.

I learned that networks are not just cables and Wi-Fi…

They are structured environments that require:

Monitoring

Configuration

Security

Troubleshooting

Without proper administration, networks become vulnerable to:

❌ Downtime
❌ Data leaks
❌ Unauthorized access

🧑‍💻 Responsibilities of a Network Administrator

I discovered that network administrators play a critical role in both operations and security.

Their responsibilities include:

🔧 Setup & Configuration

Installing routers, switches, and firewalls

Assigning IP addresses

Managing access controls

📡 Monitoring Network Activity

Ensuring systems stay online

Tracking unusual traffic

Detecting performance issues

🔐 Security Management

Implementing firewalls

Controlling user access

Preventing unauthorized connections

🛠 Maintenance

Updating systems

Optimizing performance

Backing up configurations

🚨 Troubleshooting

Fixing connectivity issues

Identifying bottlenecks

Resolving outages

This made me realize:

👉 Network admins are the first line of defense in cybersecurity.

🧩 Understanding VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks)

One of the most important concepts I learned was VLANs.

A VLAN allows a single physical network to be divided into multiple virtual networks.

Think of it like turning one office into separate secure departments:

Department	VLAN
HR	VLAN 10
Finance	VLAN 20
IT	VLAN 30

Even if everyone shares the same hardware…

They are logically separated.

Why VLANs Matter

✔️ Improve security
✔️ Reduce unnecessary traffic
✔️ Isolate sensitive data
✔️ Prevent attackers from moving freely across networks

Example:

Without VLANs → If one device is compromised, the attacker can scan the entire network.

With VLANs → The attacker is contained within that segment.

🛠 Introduction to Network Troubleshooting

I also learned the fundamentals of diagnosing network problems.

Troubleshooting is a critical skill because:

👉 Networks will always experience issues.

The key is identifying where the problem is.

Basic Troubleshooting Approach

Identify the issue

No internet?

Slow connection?

Check physical layer

Cables connected?

Devices powered on?

Verify configuration

IP address correct?

VLAN assigned properly?

Test connectivity

Can devices communicate?

Analyze traffic

Is something blocking access?

Tools like ping, traceroute, and eventually Nmap help visualize network behavior.

🧠 Key Takeaway

This week showed me that:

Cybersecurity doesn't start with hacking…

It starts with understanding:

➡️ How networks are built
➡️ How they are managed
➡️ How they fail

Because you can’t protect what you don’t understand.
