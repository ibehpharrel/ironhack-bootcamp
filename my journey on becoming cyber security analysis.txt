My Cybersecurity Journey – Starting with a Home Lab

My journey into cybersecurity began through the Ironhack bootcamp, where I was introduced to the importance of hands-on learning.

Instead of just studying theory, I built my own home lab — a safe environment where I could practice real cybersecurity tools and techniques without risking real systems.

🧰 Step 1 — Building My First Home Lab

I started by installing VirtualBox on my laptop.

👉 VirtualBox allows me to run multiple operating systems inside my main computer safely.

This created a sandbox environment where I could simulate attacks, defenses, and network activity — just like in real-world cybersecurity scenarios.

🐉 Step 2 — Installing Kali Linux

Next, I downloaded and installed Kali Linux inside VirtualBox.

Kali Linux is a penetration testing operating system used by ethical hackers and security professionals.

Inside my virtual machine, I now had access to powerful tools used for:

Network analysis

Vulnerability scanning

Ethical hacking practice

This marked my first real step into offensive security learning.

🌐 Step 3 — Scanning My Network with Nmap

Once Kali Linux was running, I began exploring one of the most important tools in cybersecurity:

➡️ Nmap (Network Mapper)

Using Nmap, I scanned my own home network to:

Discover connected devices

Identify open ports

Understand how networks expose services

This helped me learn:

✔️ How attackers map networks
✔️ How defenders detect exposure
✔️ How visibility is the first step to security

        First Step into Ethical Hacking

🧠 What I Gained

Through this process, I learned:

How virtual environments work

How ethical hackers set up labs

How networks can be mapped

How attackers identify targets

Most importantly:

👉 I moved from theory → real hands-on cybersecurity practice
